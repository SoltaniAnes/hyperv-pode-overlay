# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

This repository aims to stay small, predictable, and infrastructure-focused.
Please read the following before opening a pull request.

## Branching model

- `main` contains stable, releasable code
- `dev` is the default integration branch
- All contributions must target `dev`
- Feature and fix branches should be short-lived

---

## Pull requests

- One logical change per pull request
- Keep scope focused and intentional
- Avoid unrelated refactors or formatting-only changes
- Update documentation when behavior changes

---

## Code style

- Follow existing PowerShell patterns
- Prefer explicit, readable logic over clever abstractions
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless strictly necessary

---

## Testing
